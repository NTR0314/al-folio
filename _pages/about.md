I am a last year M.Sc. Comp. Sci. student at <a href='https://www.kit.edu/'>KIT</a>. I have a interest in developing **AGI** and am currently looking for a suitable Ph.D. / Intern position.

During my studies I worked on CV, NLP, ASR/ST. During my <a href='/assets/pdf/ba.pdf'>Bachelor's thesis</a> I worked on optimizations for robotics (Bayesian Optimization). In my <a href='/assets/pdf/ma.pdf'>Master's thesis</a> I worked on primarily on streaming ASR.
