A while ago I stumbled across a [Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/@acceptingtheuniverse) who discusses philosophy. Some of the content that he discusses are the [letters of seneca](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius).

I want to talk about Letter XX "On practicing what you preach". Through reading lots of self-help and philosophy books I came to realize that reflecting and thinking is counterproductive if not follower by action. True wisdowm shows in action not in words.

I want to encourage myself and everyone else to do things whatever it is.
